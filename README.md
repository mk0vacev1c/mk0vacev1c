# Short story about me

As a passionate Software EngineerðŸ’», I strive to build unique, modern, and maintainable software and websites to cater to all your needs. With years of experience working as a freelance developer and designer, my goal is to create impactful and innovative software solutions that help businesses grow and reach new heightsðŸš€. 
I am a dedicated, hardworking, and passionate individual who is always eager to learn and acquire new knowledge.

Aside from my work in the tech industry, I have a background in athletics as an amateur boxer. I have won several national and Balkan championships in different weight classes, which has instilled in me a strong work ethic and discipline that I bring to all areas of my life.
