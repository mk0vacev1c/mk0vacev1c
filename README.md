# Short story about me

👨‍💻 Once upon a time, in the realm of code and creativity, I embarked on a journey as a Software Engineer. With 3 years of experience under my belt, I've evolved into a React enthusiast, crafting digital magic with ⚛️ React and venturing into the vast landscapes of 🌐 Node.js.

🎓 My quest for knowledge began in the hallowed halls of academia, earning a Bachelor's Degree in IT and now pursuing the elusive Masters. My programming odyssey spanned from the deep caverns of C to the sprawling landscapes of Java, the enigmatic realms of PHP, and the structured dungeons of SQL. I even dabbled in the art of 🎨 Graphic Design, painting digital dreams.

📚 In the tranquil moments between code wars, I find solace in the company of self-growth books. 📖 With an insatiable hunger for learning, I explore new tools and technologies, forever expanding my arsenal. 🛠️

🚀 I'm on a quest to become a MERN Stack Developer, mastering the arts of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. 📦

🥊 But my journey isn't just about code; it's also a tale of resilience and discipline. In a past life, I was an 🥇 Amateur Boxer, a champion of both the national arena and the Balkan battlegrounds. The lessons of sweat and sacrifice from the boxing ring have forged a 💪 strong work ethic and discipline that I carry into all aspects of my life.

🌟 As I continue to code, learn, and grow, I'm ever eager to share my adventures with you.
